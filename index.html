	<H1> Welcome to Nina's WebPage Project for Fall 2017! </H1> 
	<H2> HEY Y'ALL! </H2>
		<p> My name is Nina Hughes but I go by my middle name Shelby. I am currently a senior at the 
		University of Georgia so you know what that means...it is time for me to get a job. As a compliment to my resume,
		I want this webpage to serve as an alternative for you to get to know me and become more familiar with my 
		goals. </p>
		
		<p> I was born and raised in Cordele, Georgia where I attended Crisp County Schools. <img src="cordele.gif" class="image1" alt="Cordele Map" height="150" width="150">
		As a middle schooler, I set a goal for myself to attend the University of Georgia. Through hard work and 
		determination that dream came true in August 2014 when I enrolled at UGA as a freshman. <img src="uga.gif" class="image2" alt="UGA logo" height="150" width="150"> My time at UGA has 
		felt like a rollercoaster at many times, through learning experiences and opportunities for growth. 
		Yet, here I am almost 4 years later wondering where all the time has gone. </p>
		
		<p> In May I will graduate with a bachelor's degree in Sport Management. Although I have more than 
		enjoyed 2 years of internship with the Georgia Football Program, I am planning on pursuing a career 
		outside of sports. After graduation, I plan to enroll in a graduate education program specializing in Special 
		Education, an area that is very close to my heart. I am also planning to begin teaching full-time as a pursue 
		my master's degree. </p>

	<H3> JUSTIFICATIONS... </H3>
		<p> You may be asking, "Shelby, why do you want to do these things?" or "Why are these your goals?". 
		Thankfully, I will explain that here. I come from a family of career educators who always made my 
		goals and dreams a priority. At times when I struggled with what to do with my life and what my
		purpose was, my family was always there to support me. </p>
		
		<p> Their support combined with a lifelong, genuine passion for serving others, I decided that 
		becoming a special education teacher specializing in early learning was my purpose. I feel most
		at home in a classroom surrounded by children. I know that teaching, especially teaching exceptional
		children will be hard at times but I also know that it will be more than rewarding at the end
		of every day and that reward with foster fulfillment in my life. I can't wait to begin this next stage
		of life! </p>
